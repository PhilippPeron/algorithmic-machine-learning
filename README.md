# Algorithmic Machine Learning Course
Repository for the lab reports and notebooks we created as a group in the course 'Algorithmic Machine Learning' short AML at Eurecom in the spring of 2022.

We were given three different machine learning challenges to complete:
## 1 Weather Prediction
Task: Temperature Prediction through Analysis of Spatial Covariance Shift in Weather Inference \
Approach: Ensemble Model\
Grade: 100/100 points

## 2 Unsupervised Sound Anomaly Detection
Task: Anomaly Sound Detection (DCASE2020 Challenge) \
Approach: Convolutional Autoencoder on Mel-Spectograms \
Grade: 100/100 points

## 3 Tweet Sentiment Analysis
Task: Tweet Sentiment Analysis \
Approach: LSTM & Fine Tuning a BERT Transformer Model \
Grade: 100/100 points
